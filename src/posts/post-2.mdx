Gatsby makes building fast, modern websites a lot more approachable — even for beginners like me.

I wanted a framework that supported:
- **Static site generation**
- **Markdown/MDX blogging**
- **Easy deployment with GitHub Pages**

After exploring a few tools, Gatsby just made the most sense. The plugin ecosystem, community support, and performance benefits are all huge pluses.

This blog is my first real step into static site development — and I’m excited to see where it leads!
