title: "Why React Hooks Finally Clicked"

At first, I didn’t fully understand `useState` or `useEffect`. But after building a few small apps, the concept finally clicked.

The idea of managing state inside a functional component instead of a class made things so much cleaner. Now I can’t imagine going back to writing `class MyComponent extends React.Component`.

Learning by doing really helped. I also recommend the React docs and the Syntax.fm podcast for learning these concepts.
