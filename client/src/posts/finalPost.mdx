Whether you're building a small app or a large-scale platform, understanding how **authentication flows** work is critical for securing user access.

### üîê What is an Authentication Flow?

An authentication flow is the process through which a user proves their identity to a system. It typically includes the following steps:

1. **Login Request**: A user enters credentials (like email and password).
2. **Verification**: The server verifies the credentials (often with hashed passwords).
3. **Token Generation**: On success, the server issues a token (e.g., a JWT).
4. **Session Handling**: The client stores this token (often in localStorage or a secure cookie).
5. **Access Protected Routes**: The client uses the token to make authenticated API calls.

### üîÑ Common Flow Variants

- **Session-based Authentication**: Stores user info on the server (cookie + session).
- **Token-based Authentication**: Uses JWTs for stateless authentication.
- **OAuth Flow**: Delegates authentication to providers like Google, GitHub, etc.

### üö® Why It Matters

If authentication isn‚Äôt handled securely:
- User data may be exposed.
- Attackers could hijack sessions.
- APIs may be misused.

A well-structured authentication flow is essential for protecting your application and building user trust.
