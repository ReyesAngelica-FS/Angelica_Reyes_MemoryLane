When I first started learning JavaScript, I made all the rookie mistakes — and that’s okay. But if I could send a message to Past Me, here’s what I’d say:

### 1. **It’s Not Just About Syntax**
Learning `for` loops and `if` statements is great, but the real magic happens when you start thinking in **logic**. Focus on how to solve problems, not just how to write code.

### 2. **Console.log Is Your Best Friend**
Forget the fancy tools at first. `console.log()` will help you figure out what your code is doing (or not doing) 99% of the time.

### 3. **Projects > Tutorials**
I spent too much time watching tutorials and not enough time building. The moment I started making little projects—like a to-do list or a random quote generator—I actually started learning.

JavaScript can feel intimidating, but it becomes fun when you realize it’s just you talking to your browser. And the browser (usually) listens.
