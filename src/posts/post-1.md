Building my first static site with Gatsby was easier than I expected. I started by running `npm init gatsby` and followed the prompts to create my project.

What I liked most was how simple it was to use Markdown files for blog posts. Instead of dealing with a database, I could just write `.md` files and let Gatsby handle the rest!

Deploying to GitHub Pages with `gh-pages` was also a cool learning experience.
