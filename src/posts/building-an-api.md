![API Diagram](../images/api-diagram.png)

Building an API was one of the most rewarding parts of my developer journey so far. Using Node.js and Express, I created routes like `/recipes` and `/contacts`, connected to a MongoDB database, and tested everything with Postman.

If you're starting out, I recommend beginning with simple `GET` and `POST` routes and gradually adding database integration. Once you understand the basics, deploying to a platform like Render or Railway is a great next step!
